# Green-Sustainable-Supply-Chain
A new Dimension of classifying Supply chains is proposed which shall have the only objective of reducing emissions. Further secondary objectives of minimizing supply chain cost and allowing additional profit sharing may be considered. However the transition of Efficient and Responsive Supply Chains into Sustainably Efficient and Sustainable Responsive Supply Chains so that ultimately only Green Sustainable Supply Chains may be allowed is the only goal of a civilization to ensure Sustainable Progress on the Kardashev Scale.


All the individual folders have the same Python File "Sustainable Facility location to reduce Emissions.py".

In the "Grainger" folder, the data on which this is run is only for W.W.Grainger's Supply Chain.
In the "McMaster" folder, the data on which this is run is only for McMaster-Carr's Supply Chain.

In the "Grainger and McMaster" folder, the data on which this is run is combining the data from both the above folders. It can be seen that when combining both the supply chains (i.e. combining their Customers, their Suppliers as well as their Branches and DistributionCentres's we can obtain lesser emissions.

The main assumption is that each link considered here is assumed to being catered to by a single vehicle. This may be altered so that the fixed and variable emissions of the facilities may remain but combining the problem with an extensive real world heterogeneous VRP allowing Simultaneous Delivery and PickUp's of wastes (i.e. enabling backchannels for backhauling wastes which must be recycled). This will ensure survival of ou species and reduce emissions and Global Warming threats thereby preventing Climate Change.
